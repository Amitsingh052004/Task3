This eCommerce database program was developed using MySQL, covering essential relational concepts like foreign keys, joins, and data normalization.

Advanced SQL features like views, subqueries, and indexing were also implemented for performance and analytical insights. I have saved all the table,data and other practical query is written in the Pdf.
